# Project Management System (PMS)

This is the Project Management System (PMS) web application. It provides a centralized platform to plan, track, and manage projects efficiently.

## Overview

The PMS welcome page (`public/welcome.html`) serves as the opening page for users, introducing key features such as Dashboard, Task Management, and Collaboration. The page is styled with custom CSS located in `public/css/pms-style.css` to provide a clean and professional look.

## Features

- **Dashboard:** Overview of projects, tasks, and deadlines.
- **Task Management:** Create, assign, and track tasks.
- **Collaboration:** Communicate and collaborate with team members seamlessly.

## Project Structure

  - `welcome.html` - The main welcome page for the PMS.
  - `css/pms-style.css` - Custom CSS styles for the PMS welcome page.
- `src/` - Source code for the backend and application logic (not detailed here).
