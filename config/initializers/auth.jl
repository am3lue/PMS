# Authentication initializer
# This file can be used to set up authentication-related configurations,
# such as session management, secret keys, or middleware.

# For now, this is a placeholder for future authentication setup.

# Example: Enable sessions (uncomment if needed)
# using Genie.Sessions
# Genie.Sessions.enable_sessions()
